Update JavaScript (in index file)
to make the code DRY and clean!

Current development is in index2.html

Problem: 
Something is wrong with the use of requestAnimationFrame
there at the moment. 
In generates an error. 

Most helpful info found so far is located here: 
https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/JavaScript/Window/requestAnimationFrame
Need to spend more time to understand the whole thing!
