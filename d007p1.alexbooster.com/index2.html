        <h1>Advanced CSS:<br>
            animated info icon call to action</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="wrapper">
        <p>Sooo?.... What do you think?</p>
        <p>Do you think you can manage to leave this page
            <br> without taking the action I'm forcing your brain to take?</p>
        <p>Maybe you can because I'm posing it as a challenge now.
            <br>But what if you landed on a web page with some other content
            <br> and nobody would even mention anything about that info icon?</p>
        <p>Also important: Would you feel in any way annoyed if that info icon just
            <br> rolled out &quot;out of the blue&quot; and started &quot;calling&quot; for your action the way my info icon does?</p>
        <p>Doesn't feel annyoing, right? :-)</p>
        <p>What would normally happen is that the user would first move their mouse over the info icon
            <br>(without necessarily having the intention to click it).
            <br> And once there, the user would think:
            <br>
            <em>&quot;What the heck! I might just as well click it now!&quot;</em></p>
        <p>And that, my friend, is the art of persuasion and the art of website conversion.</p>
        <p>Subtle things like this innocent looking little info icon that can make a difference between a
            <br> business website that's barely making ends meet and a
            <br> business website that outsells all of their competition!</p>
        <p>I'm not saying you should put this info icon onto every business website. No.
            <br> What I am saying is that:
            <br> 1) I have a very clear understanding of who exactly the visitors of my project pages are and
            <br> 2) I have a very clear idea of what exactly I want those visitors to do
            <br> when they land on any of my project pages. </p>
        <p>I then come up with the things I need to implement in a given case in order
            <br> to virtually <strong style="color: red;">force</strong> the users to do exactly what I want them to do
            <br>and do that without being obnoxious.
        </p>
        <p>The job of a typical business website is to make money for the business.
            <br> And you do that by converting website visitors into leads and sales. </p>
        <p>Now, &quot;leads&quot; in my case here means something totally different
            <br> than you'd typically have on a business website.
            <br> And actually, I have 2 very different kinds of leads in my case here. </p>
        <p>
            But even though those are 2 very different groups of people
            <br>I want both of those user groups to take the action I prescribed for them to take
            <br> which is to click the info icon and to consume the easy-to-digest information
            <br> that will pop up upon clicking that icon. </p>
        <p>After that the users of those 2 user groups will diverge and perform different actions
            <br>(depending on the group they belong to).
            <br>But getting all those people to click the info icon is the first and critically important step
            <br>when it comes to converting those users into leads. </p>
        <p>P.S.: Have you noticed that I just called you a &quot;friend&quot;?
            <br>That didn't feel in any way awkward, did it? :-)
            <br>Well, in case you're starting to feel that I might be one of your buddies,
            <br>that's totally normal because I can't help but use my persuasion skills when writing
            <br> and here I'm just overtly telling you that. :-)
            <br>I was working for over a decade in marketing before I turned myself into a web developer.
            <br> So, that's my background.</p>
