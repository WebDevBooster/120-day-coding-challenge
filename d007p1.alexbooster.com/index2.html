        <h1>Advanced CSS:<br>
            animated info icon call to action</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="wrapper">
        <p>Sooo?.... What do you think?</p>
        <p>Do you think you can manage to leave thing page
            <br> without taking the action I'm forcing your brain to take?</p>
        <p>Maybe you can because I'm posing it as a challenge now.
            <br>But what if you landed on a web page with some other content
            <br> and nobody would even mention anything about that info icon?</p>
        <p>Also important: Would you feel in any way annoyed if that info icon just
            <br> rolled out &quot;out of the blue&quot; and started &quot;calling&quot; for your action the way my info icon does?</p>
        <p>Doesn't feel annyoing, right? :-)</p>
        <p>What would normally happen is that the user would first
            <br> move their mouse over the info icon (without necessarily having the intention to click it).
            <br> And once there, the user would think:
            <br>
            <em>&quot;What the heck! I might just as well click it now!&quot;</em></p>
        <p>And that, my friend, is the art of persuasion and the art of website conversion.</p>
        <p>Subtle things like that can make a difference between a
            <br> business website that's barely making ends meet and a
            <br> business website that outsells all of their competitors!</p>
        <p>P.S.: Have you noticed that I just called you a &quot;friend&quot;?
            <br>That didn't feel in any way awkward, did it? :-)
            <br>Well, in case you're starting to feel that I might be one of your buddies,
            <br>it's totally normal because I can't help but use my persuasion skills when writing.
            <br>I was working for over a decade in marketing before I turned myself into a web developer.</p>
        <p>P.P.S.: In it's current form the info icon has a few flaws right now. But I'm gonna fix that tomorrow.
            <br> Also, clicking the info icon now doesn't actually do anything at the moment.</p>
