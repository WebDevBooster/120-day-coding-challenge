                        <h3>Big Ben</h3>
                        <h5>A British cultural icon, Big Ben is one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom. </h5>

                            <p>Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London[1] and is usually extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower as well. The tower is officially known as Elizabeth Tower, renamed to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012; previously, it was known simply as the Clock Tower.</p>
                            <p>When completed in 1859, it was “the prince of timekeepers: the biggest, most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world.” The tower had its 150th anniversary on 31 May 2009, during which celebratory events took place.</p>
                            <p>The Elizabeth Tower and Great Bell have been scheduled for a major renovation that is expected to last four years and began in August 2017, with Big Ben's chimes being silenced on 21 August at 12 noon. Essential maintenance will be carried out on the clock mechanism, which will be stopped for several months, during which there will be no chimes. Striking and tolling will however be maintained for important events such as New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday. Big Ben will resume striking and tolling in 2021.</p>

                        <h5>Tower Bridge is an iconic symbol of London, resulting in it sometimes being confused with London Bridge.</h5>

                            <p>The Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built between 1886 and 1894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London.</p>
                            <p>The bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers.</p>
                            <p>The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway</p>

                        <h3>The Gherkin</h3>
                        <h5>This building has become a recognisable feature of London.</h5>

                        <div class="expandingPanel" data-link-text="Read more">
                            <p>Officially known as 30 St Mary Axe, the Gherkin (previously known as the Swiss Re Building) is one of the city's most widely recognised examples of contemporary architecture.</p>
                            <p>It is 180 metres (591 ft) tall and has 41 storeys/floors. On the building's top level (the 40th floor), there is a bar for tenants and their guests, featuring a panoramic view of London. A restaurant operates on the 39th floor, and private dining rooms on the 38th.</p>
                            <p>Whereas most buildings have extensive lift equipment on the roof of the building, this was not possible for the Gherkin, since a bar had been planned for the 40th floor. The architects dealt with this by having the main lift only reach the 34th floor, and then having a push-from-below lift to the 39th floor. There is a marble stairwell and a disabled persons' lift, which leads the visitor up to the bar in the dome.</p>
                            <p>The building is visible over long distances: From the north, for instance, it can be seen from the M11 motorway, some 32 kilometres (20 mi) away.</p>
